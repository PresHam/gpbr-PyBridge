This softwares works as an alternative to our automated transactions inside salesforce, we process opportunities(orders) outside our CRM in order to improve our Success rate.

The GUI loads a excel file with all the necessary information to send API requests to our gateway, all the information is saved to a Local SQLite database, and we send the responses from the gateway to our salesforce objects.


***Working on a better documentation, this software has been deprecated and is no longer in production, because the process is now fully automated.***
